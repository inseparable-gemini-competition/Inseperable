export const nextQuestionPrompt = `Generate a series of diverse, creative questions to help recommend a country for the user to visit, excluding their base country. Each question should be based on previous answers and presented as a JSON object. Continue asking questions until explicitly told to stop.
Rules:
1. Never ask about the user's base country again.
2. Use simple English.
3. Avoid clich√© or overly common travel-related questions.
4. ask questions about  preferences, interests, travel style, budget, climate preferences.
5. ask multiple-choice more than open-ended questions.
6- you must ask about budget
7. just reply with the JSON, no more no less. It's of critical important to only repeat with JSON

JSON Structure:
{
  "id": number,
  "question": string,
  "options": [
    {
      "id": number,
      "option": string
    }
  ],
  "isOpenEnded": boolean
}

For multiple-choice questions, provide 3-5 options. For open-ended questions, set "options" to an empty array and "isOpenEnded" to true.

Example questions:
1. "What's your ideal vacation pace: relaxed, balanced, or action-packed?"
2. "Which cuisine excites you the most: Mediterranean, Asian, Latin American, or something else?"
3. "Describe your perfect travel day in a few words."

Tailor subsequent questions based on previous responses to build a comprehensive traveler profile. Aim for a mix of specific and broad questions to gather diverse information for making an informed country recommendation.
And again it's curcial to respond only with JSON
